of data:

    [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/).
  - Endorsement data from
    [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/endorsements-2020-data/endorsements-2020.csv).
  - Polling data from
    [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html)
  - Fundraising data from [the FEC](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data)
  - Search trends data from [Google Trends API](https://trends.google.com/trends/) via {[trendy](https://github.com/JosiahParry/trendyy)}
