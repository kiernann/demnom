This project is a collection of data tracking the 2020 Democratic
Primary.

Instead of relying on polling alone, this project contains three types
of data:

  - Market data from
    [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/).
  - Endorsement data from
    [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/endorsements-2020-data/endorsements-2020.csv).
  - Polling data from
    [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html)
